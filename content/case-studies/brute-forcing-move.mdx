## June: A Stalled Career Path Meets an Eight-Year Goal

I had wanted to move to the US for almost a decade, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

A few failed private equity interview processes later, I was in limbo – didn’t know how to move to the US and my current employer wasn’t budging.

At some point, it became clear that the only real option was to take control of the situation myself. Similarly, I wanted to try out an operating role in tech (investing had made me feel like I wasn’t really learning how to run companies).

So I put in my 3 months’ notice and left.

Three months to get employed.

## The Breakthrough: Discovering Apollo + Gmail + ChatGPT

What began as an attempt to manually craft cold emails quickly became a system.

Apollo handled volume and deliverability.

ChatGPT generated the templates I needed.

Five newly created emails (warmed across the way) became the backbone for my cold emails.

Together, they became a scalable outbound engine, something close to having a small SDR team attached to my job search.

## System Design

The intention here was to build a scalable system in the same way that an operator would: build fast, trust the numbers, and iterate when things don’t work. My IB / PE background made the process feel familiar – high volume, structured communication, clean data, and moving fast under pressure.

### Target Criteria

- Series A – C startups
- Founded post-2020 / 2021 (hypergrowth signals)
- Backed by credible investors (Sequoia, a16z, ICONIQ, and big tech venture arms)
- Contacts who were decision-makers, not recruiters
- Role focus on strategy, operations, finance, and GTM / sales

### Operating Cadence

- Peak volume of ~250 emails/day
- 10–12 intro calls/week
- 20 minutes prep per intro call
- Iterated sequences whenever reply rate <10%
- Weekends reserved for recovery
- Gmail used to maintain organic deliverability

### Conversion Rules

- If role open, ask immediately for a referral
- If no role open, build relationship and stay in touch
- Many “no role” conversations converted later

## July: Gaining Traction

After a few days of near-zero movement, I woke up one morning to three call acceptances. I began scheduling 6–8 a.m. calls before my 70-hour work week and slowly accumulated early interview processes. At the same time, my previous employer was working to move me to the US. This process stalled by a full month in between interview rounds. That was clarifying. I dropped out and doubled down on outbound.

I generated five live interview processes by August.

## August – September: The Chaos Spike

I had a holiday booked in Japan and while I was in my hotel, a high growth AI hardware company asked me to fly to California on 24 hours notice for final round interviews. I completed a superday, received an offer, negotiated it, and accepted.

I flew home with a job offer in hand – it felt surreal that I could finally move.

Until it was rescinded for company specific reasons.

It was jarring, but I rebuilt the funnel immediately and launched a second, much larger wave of outreach, this time generating 12 new active processes in a month.

## October: Bouncing Back and the Funnel at Full Scale

My notice period ended. I was now unemployed. I immediately booked a ticket to the US and left. At this time, I had progressed a number of these interviews to late stages and just needed to wrap up an offer so I could move overseas. I spent time flying between SF and NY and ended up maturing this funnel.

Because I’m now in RevOps, here’s the funnel diagram for each stage and my conversions to next stage.

The companies spanned developer infrastructure, AI workflow automation, AI search, fintech, GTM tooling, and analytics. I ultimately chose a Series B analytics company in a RevOps role, because:

- The interview process completed in three days (positive signal for execution rigor)
- Founders had a strong track record in scaling and exiting businesses
- Strong role fit – I was deep into learning about GTM and was looking for a high leverage operating role

## Key Learnings & What Didn’t Work

Some lessons and mistakes to keep note of for next time:

- Attaching my resume upfront lowered response rates: relational > transactional always
- Accidentally emailed multiple people at the same company
- Learned that rejection is just funnel attrition, not feedback on competence
- Progress is not linear – I got no responses some days, generated three interviews overnight on others
- This probably would not have worked without E-3 eligibility ([https://americajosh.com/learn-more/immigration/e3-visa](https://americajosh.com/learn-more/immigration/e3-visa/?srsltid=AfmBOopDhSVI84gC1O61ALTKDOwsLrwNrPUBrzJOYdqf-cqgwCYkIYSt))

Here are a few memorable responses (some paraphrased, some not) that reminded me that this was a numbers game:

- “Unsubscribe” (this was not paraphrased)
- “Why would you ever leave PE? Seems like an awful waste of effort – why don’t you wait for the big bucks to come in?”
- “[from the founder] Can you stop emailing us? [redacted] is no longer at this company”
- “You’re not trying to sell something, right?”

## Conclusion: A Job Search Is a Sales Funnel

The fact that this succeeded remains, to date, one of the achievements in my life that I’m most proud of. Trying to move countries with no job can feel like an arcane process, but it is effectively a sales funnel, characterised by high volume, low initial probability of success, and a requirement for the seller to put in a ton of grunt work.

For the people that took the time out of their day to call me, thank you. For the people I unknowingly spammed, I apologise! And for people in my personal life trying to replicate this move, good luck!
